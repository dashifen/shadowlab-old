<p>Greetings $username,</p>

<p>
    In order to reset your account for the ShadowLab, click the link below.  Once the page loads,
    enter the email address to which this message was sent as well as the confirmation code below
    online.  Assuming everything works out, you'll then be able to update your password.  If you
    did not request that your account be reset, someone else may have.  The good news is that
    unless they can also read this email, your account is safe.  Just use this information to
    enter a new password and that will allow you to access the ShadowLab once again.
