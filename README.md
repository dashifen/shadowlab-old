# ShadowLab

An application reading from a private database of information related to the table-top roleplaying 
game Shadowrun Fifth Edition for my use during game mastering sessions. Yes, I'm really this much 
of a nerd.

The information contained within the databases cannot be shared so don't ask.  The Topps Company, Inc. 
has sole ownership of the names, logo, artwork, marks, photographs, sounds, audio, video and/or any 
proprietary material used in connection with the game Shadowrun. The Topps Company, Inc. has granted 
permission to tohers to use such names, logos, artwork, marks and/or any proprietary materials for 
promotional and informational purposes but does not endorse, and is not affiliated with me, you, 
that guy, or frankly most people who use their property in any official capacity whatsoever. 

Theoretically, if you want to use this software to try and assist during your own games, it would 
be possible, but you'll have to re-create all the databases yourself, a labor I've undertaken with 
the help of my players for since February 2014.  More power to you, but frankly you (and I) are 
probably better off using text searches in the PDFs!

## Project Goals
 - To create an object oriented application from a previously programmed functional/class oriented 
 tool developed over the last year.
 - To practice and hone my OOP skills and to learn more about framework development.
 - To have a good time playing Shadowrun Fifth Edition.

If you browse the repo, feel free to make suggestions and offer constructive criticism. This level of OOP 
programming is new to me so advice is welcome.  On the other hand, if you feel the need to mock those who 
try to learn new things and maybe don't quite get it right the first time out of the gate, please just go 
away?  Thanks.
